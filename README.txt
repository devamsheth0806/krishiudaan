This is an web portal for farmers, govt. officials and agriculture scientists.
It has the following funtionalities:
1.	Weather forecast location wise: Weather forecast is the most important feature for an agriculture helper application. If the farmer has up-to-date weather forecast information, he can plan ahead and take actions accordingly to preserve his crop to maximize life and yield. 
2.	Account Handling: The application will have mandatory sign up which will lead to no misuse of the app. There will be no charge for sign up and just by giving the mobile number.	
3.	Soil Health Card: Different geographical locations can have many different soil types, varying in their alkalinity types and nutrient values, making them unsuitable for some crops and better for others. A farmer needs to maintain a soil card, with report of the soil alkalinity level and the amount of essential nutrients.
4.	Online Support: Online support through chat style messaging with government approved technical experts will be made available so that the farmers can have all their queries answered without any hassle and without having to wait on the phone for long periods of time.
5.	Daily Market Prices: Farmers often get cheated by the middlemen between them and consumers as middlemen often cheat them by giving them an unfair price for their crop even though the government fixes crop prices on a daily basis so as to ensure the sustenance of the farmer. This app will get updated with the latest crop prices so that the farmer is always aware of the fair price he should receive for his yield.
